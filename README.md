## Overview

This ia my first project with Vue js framework. It is just a simple todo app I made it as a training on Vue js concepts.
It has some cool features such as dark & light mode and filtering tasks.  
I really liked the framework it is much easier than react. And I hope to make more projects with it.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Create a new todo
- See a lsit of all the todos
- Toggle the todo as completed or not through a checkbox button
- Delete a single todo
- Delete all the completed todos
- Show a list of the active todos only
- Show a list of the completed todos only

## My process

### Built with

- HTMl & CSS
- [Vue 3 ](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to use most of Vue js features such as (computed properties , props , watchers , directives,etc.)
The most intersting thing I found in Vue are directives I really enjoyed using them they make the work easy so much
and I read the section of directives in the documentation many times to see all the features that I can make us of.

### Continued development

I want to learn more advanced topics in Vue like state management and SSR, so I can implement them in my next project.
